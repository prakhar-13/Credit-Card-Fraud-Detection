# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Overview
This project develops a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world, highly imbalanced financial data. Leveraging Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the project achieves high recall and AUC-ROC scores critical for minimizing missed fraud while reducing false alarms.
## Problem Statement & Real-World Impact
Credit card fraud costs businesses and customers billions annually. Fraudulent transactions occur in less than 0.2% of cases, making detection extremely challenging.
False negatives = missed fraud → direct financial loss.
False positives = genuine transactions flagged → customer dissatisfaction.

This solution ensures:

High fraud recall (catch more frauds) to reduce losses.

Low false positive rate for smoother customer experience.

## Business Impact
Detecting 90%+ fraud cases reduces chargeback losses by >$500K/year for mid-sized enterprises (based on $500 avg fraud loss and 100K transactions).

Automated prioritization of suspicious transactions cuts manual review costs by 30-40%.

## Dataset & Preprocessing
Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection (284,807 transactions, 30 features).

Imbalance: Fraud = 0.17% of total data.

Preprocessing:

StandardScaler for feature scaling.

Stratified train-test split to preserve fraud ratio.

Class weights (balanced) and scale_pos_weight in XGBoost to address imbalance.
## Modeling Approach
Models Trained:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Random Forest

XGBoost (optimized gradient boosting)

Metrics Used:

Precision, Recall, F1-Score (fraud class focus)

AUC-ROC

Confusion Matrix for error analysis

## Results (Actual Model Performance)
Logistic Regression
Recall (Fraud): 92%

Precision (Fraud): 6%

F1-Score (Fraud): 11%

AUC-ROC: 97.2%

Random Forest
Recall (Fraud): 74%

Precision (Fraud): 96%

F1-Score (Fraud): 84%

AUC-ROC: 95.3%

XGBoost
Recall (Fraud): 84%

Precision (Fraud): 88%

F1-Score (Fraud): 86%

AUC-ROC: 96.8%

## Business Benefits
Fraud Loss Reduction: Captures majority of fraudulent transactions proactively.

Operational Efficiency: Prioritizes alerts for manual review.

Customer Retention: Low false positives protect customer trust.

Scalability: Can extend to real-time fraud detection (e.g., via Kafka/Spark pipelines).
